## **Terms of Service**
 <div className = "row p-2 mx-2" style = {{fontWeight: '400'}}>

Greetings from Rovxr! We've put together these Terms of Service to ensure a smooth sailing experience for everyone.

- **Rovxr**: When we mention "Company," "we," "our," or "us".

- **Services**: This covers any product brought to you by Rovxr.

- **You**: Refers to individuals or organizations with an account for our Services.

We may update these terms in the future. By using our Services, now or later, you agree to the latest version. This applies to all current and future products and features. Please note, not enforcing any right or provision doesn't mean we're giving it up—it's all part of these terms.

Violating these terms may result in account termination. This requires trust on both sides.

 </div>

### **Account Terms**

 <div className = "row p-2 mx-2" style = {{fontWeight: '400'}}>

- You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password. We cannot be held liable for any loss or damage resulting from your failure to comply with this security obligation.

- All content posted and activities that occur under your account are your responsibility. This includes content posted by others who either: (a) have access to your login credentials; or (b) have their own logins under your account.

- Accounts must be created and operated by humans. Accounts registered by “bots” or other automated methods are not permitted.

- The Services may not be used for any purpose outlined in our Use Restrictions policy.

 </div>

### **Use Restrictions**

 <div className = "row p-2 mx-2" style = {{fontWeight: '400'}}>

We acknowledge that technology, while often used with good intentions, can also amplify potential harm. To counteract this, we have established a policy rooted in ethical responsibility. It is imperative to clarify that Rovxr products are not a platform for activities that facilitate harm. Users with accounts must not employ our products for any of the restricted purposes listed below. Violations of these terms will result in appropriate action.

 </div>

#### **Restricted Purposes**
 <div className = "row p-2 mx-2" style = {{fontWeight: '400'}}>


- **Violence or Threats Thereof**: You may not use Rovxr products for any activity that qualifies as violent crime under applicable US, national, federal, state, local, or international law or regulation.

- **Child Exploitation, Sexualization, or Abuse**: Activities involving the creation, dissemination, or promotion of child abuse are strictly prohibited.

- **Hate Speech**: Advocating for the extermination, domination, or oppression of individuals or groups is strictly prohibited. Exploiting or attempting to exploit or harm minors in any way is not allowed.

- **Harassment**: Intimidating or targeting individuals or groups through repeated communication, including using racial slurs or dehumanizing language, is not welcome.

- **Doxing**: Using Rovxr products to share other people’s private personal information for the purposes of harassment is not acceptable.

- **Malware or Spyware**: Creating or distributing malware, spyware, or engaging in remote user surveillance is strictly prohibited.

- **Phishing or Attempting Fraud**: Lying about your identity or affiliation to steal from, extort, or harm others is not acceptable.

- **Cybersquatting**: Purchasing a Rovxr product account in someone else’s name and then attempting to sell that account to them is considered cybersquatting. Cybersquatting accounts are subject to immediate cancellation.

- **Infringing on Intellectual Property**: You may not use our products to create or disseminate work that uses the intellectual property of others beyond the bounds of fair use.

- **Fake News**: You cannot generate or disseminate verifiably false information and/or content with the purpose of harming others.

- **Defaming Others**: You cannot defame, disparage, or otherwise harass others.

#### **Further Restrictions**
 <div className = "row p-2 mx-2" style = {{fontWeight: '400'}}>


Our use restrictions aim to be comprehensive but may not cover every possible offense. In such cases, we will take action to address any new or unanticipated situations. The overarching principle is clear: Rovxr is not to be utilized for harm, whether mental, physical, personal, or civic. While diverse perspectives are welcomed, ideologies rooted in oppression, violence, abuse, or domination over others will not be accepted here.

While our use restrictions are comprehensive, they can’t be exhaustive — it’s possible an offense could defy categorization, present for the first time, or illuminate a moral quandary we hadn’t yet considered. That said, we hope the overarching spirit is clear: Rovxr is not to be harnessed for harm, whether mental, physical, personal, or civic. Different points of view — philosophical, religious, and political — are welcome, but ideologies like nazism, communism, or hate-fueled movements anchored by oppression, violence, abuse, extermination, or domination of one group over another, will not be accepted here.

 </div>

### **Reporting Abuse**
 <div className = "row p-2 mx-2" style = {{fontWeight: '400'}}>


If you suspect instances of malware, spyware, phishing, spamming, or cybersquatting, please [let us know](/contact).

 </div>

### **Payments**

 <div className = "row p-2 mx-2" style = {{fontWeight: '400'}}>

- Certain features of the Service may require payment.
- You can choose between one-time payments or monthly subscriptions (subject to updates). Detailed pricing and plan differences can be found [here](/pricing).

- When upgrading or downgrading your subscription plan, the new rate applies from the next billing cycle. If you upgrade in the middle of a monthly subscription, charges will be prorated for the remaining term.

- Service prices include applicable sales tax based on your location. The specific tax rate will be determined by state and local tax regulations.

- Payments for the Product/Service can be made with a credit or debit card or with cryptocurrency. These transactions are handled by third-party service providers.
 </div>

### **Uptime, Security, and Privacy**
 <div className = "row p-2 mx-2" style = {{fontWeight: '400'}}>


- Your use of the Services is at your sole risk. We provide these Services on an "as is" and "as available" basis. While we take uptime seriously, we do not currently offer service-level agreements for most of our Services.

- We may temporarily disable your account if your usage significantly exceeds the average of other customers. In such cases, we'll contact you first, except in rare instances where high usage may affect service performance for others.

- We employ various measures like backups, redundancies, and encryption to safeguard your data. Data transmission over the public Internet is encrypted for added security.

- To run the Services, we rely on third-party vendors and hosting partners who provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology.
 </div>

### **Copyright and Content Ownership**

### **Features and Bugs**

 <div className = "row p-2 mx-2" style = {{fontWeight: '400'}}>

We put great effort into crafting our Services, drawing from both our own expertise and the valuable feedback of our customers. However, it's important to recognize that no service can cater to every individual's preferences. While we strive to deliver a top-notch experience, we cannot assure you that our Service will perfectly align with your unique requirements or expectations.

Before releasing any feature, we subject it to rigorous testing. Like all software, our Service may still contain occasional bugs. We diligently track the issues reported to us, prioritizing those related to security and privacy. Please note that not every reported bug will be addressed, and we cannot guarantee a completely flawless Service.
